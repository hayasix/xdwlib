System Requirements

    - Microsoft Windows (versions compatible with DocuWorks 7 and 8)

    - Python 3.7+

    - DocuWorks 7.0+ (Japanese version; English version is not tested)

Install from archive
--------------------

Set PATH environment variable properly and issue the following command::

    python3 setup.py install

This will install xdwlib in $PYTHONPATH/xdwlib.

Install from PyPI
-----------------

Xdwlib is also delivered via Python Package Index (PyPI).  The latest
version of xdwlib will be installed by issuing::

    pip3 install xdwlib

If you have installed older version of xdwlib already, try::

    pip3 install --upgrade xdwlib

Optional Modules
----------------

PIL (Python Imaging Library)
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

Xdwlib has been working with PIL (Python Imaging Library) if available,
to rotate pages for desired degrees other than right angles, and to copy
bitmap annotations.  Unfortunately the original PIL has not been ported
on Python 3 yet.

There is an alternative library called `Pillow` which will be a good
substitution.  Install Pillow by issuing::

    pip3 install pillow

cx_Freeze
'''''''''

The attached command line tool ``xdw2text.py`` can be compiled to .exe
with cx_Freeze package, a popular successor of py2exe.  To build your
own ``xdw2text.exe``, try::

    pip3 install cx_Freeze
    python3 cx_setup.py build


Typical Use
===========

The following code will appy OCR and paste a date stamp on every page
as an annotation::

    import time

    from xdwlib import xdwopen, Point

    ...

    with xdwopen(PATHNAME, autosave=True) as doc:
        position = Point(pg.size - 100, pg.size - 20)
        datestamp = time.strftime("%Y-%m-%d")
        for pg in doc:
            pg.rotate(auto=True)
            pg.ocr(strategy="accuracy")
            ann = pg.add_text(position=position, text=datestamp)
            ann.fore_color = "red"

The author appreciate bugs reports from you by email.
