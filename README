    from xdwlib import xdwopen, Point

    ...

    with xdwopen(PATHNAME, autosave=True) as doc:
        position = Point(pg.size - 100, pg.size - 20)
        datestamp = time.strftime("%Y-%m-%d")
        for pg in doc:
            pg.rotate(auto=True)
            pg.ocr(strategy="accuracy")
            ann = pg.add_text(position=position, text=datestamp)
            ann.fore_color = "red"
